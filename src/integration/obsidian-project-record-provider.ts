/**
 * ObsidianProjectRecordProvider — the real, host-specific ProjectRecordProvider.
 *
 * Implements the approved WP14 specification
 * (docs/specifications/CC_Phase 4_WP14 Obsidian ProjectRecordProvider Specification.md),
 * governed by ACP-008 and the WP13 composition-root decision (Option B).
 *
 * SCOPE — see the specification for the full boundary. Summarized here:
 * - A Markdown file is a candidate iff its frontmatter contains the
 *   `project_id` key (§4). No folder/path/filename convention is used.
 * - Fields are mapped directly from frontmatter with no invention, no
 *   defaults, no repair (§5).
 * - A duplicate project_id is diagnosed and ALL candidates sharing that id
 *   are excluded, before validation — never a silently-chosen "winner"
 *   (§8). Checking duplicates first means a valid file never survives
 *   merely because its duplicate counterpart happened to fail validation
 *   for an unrelated reason.
 * - Every surviving candidate passes through the existing
 *   validateProjectRecord() (§6). This module never redefines validation.
 * - An invalid candidate is diagnosed and excluded; it never blocks other
 *   valid candidates (§7).
 * - Results are returned sorted lexicographically by project_id, never by
 *   incidental vault/filesystem order (§9).
 * - No Command Center-owned cache: every call re-reads the vault's current
 *   metadata state via Obsidian's own platform read mechanism (§11).
 * - Read-only. No project file is ever created, modified, or written (§12).
