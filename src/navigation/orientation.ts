/**
 * Orientation element — sibling-resolution, object-based paging, and
 * Up/Top availability/destination logic.
 *
 * Implements: Phase 3 Architecture Record, Section C (object-based sibling
 * paging rule, Up/Top behavior) — WP12 Steps 1, 2, and 3. This module
 * contains pure functions with no Obsidian runtime dependency, per WP10's
 * isolation requirement and the WP12 implementation sequence (steps 4–6
 * build on this file but are not implemented here).
 *
 * Per Section C: `<<`/`>>` always navigate among the siblings of the
 * *current object*, not the current screen. The current object is either
 * a category (at Category/List depth) or a project within an active
 * category (at Dashboard/Workspace depth).
 *
 * Step 1 (below) resolves the raw sibling set for both cases: "what are
 * the siblings of this object?"
 *
 * Step 2 (below) answers a related but distinct question: "what are the
 * available navigation targets from this object?" — wrapping Step 1's
 * results as typed `CurrentObject` targets NavigationController acts on.
 * Per the approved Step 2 scope, `resolvePaging()` does not perform a
 * transition, does not mutate any state, and does not touch rendering —
 * it is a pure resolver, the same as everything in Step 1.
 *
 * Step 3 (below) resolves the two fixed vertical actions, `Up` and `Top`.
 * Unlike Steps 1–2, these are depth-changing operations, which is why
 * Step 3 introduces `Depth` and `NavigationDestination` — concepts
 * `CurrentObject` cannot represent (see the WP12 Step 3 specification's
 * "Architectural Boundary" section for why these types are intentionally
 * kept separate).
 *
 * Step 4 (below) resolves the persistent orientation element's center
 * label string. It performs no `ProjectRecord` lookups — the caller is
 * responsible for retrieving a project's name before calling
 * `resolveLabel`, which formats labels only from values it is given. For
 * dashboard/workspace destinations, an omitted `projectName` is treated
 * as programmer error and throws; no fallback label is produced.
