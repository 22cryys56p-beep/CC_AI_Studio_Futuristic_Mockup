/**
 * OrientationBarComponent — rendering and click interaction for the
 * persistent orientation element's five components.
 *
 * WP12 Step 5, Slice 4 established pure rendering (no click handlers).
 * Slice 5 added click interaction wiring, with interim self-owned
 * re-rendering. Slice 7 (this revision) moves render ownership to
 * CommandCenterView — this component no longer calls this.render()
 * from its own click handlers; it calls an injected onStateChange
 * callback instead.
 *
 * Architectural boundary (frozen, per Slice 4/5/7 approval): this
 * component must NEVER call resolvePaging or resolveUp directly, and
 * does not. NavigationController remains the sole owner of all
 * resolver calls, including via the action methods (pagePrevious,
 * pageNext, goUp, goTop) this component invokes from click handlers.
 * This component only ever reads NavigationController.getState() (for
 * object/depth) and NavigationController.getAvailability() (for
 * disabled-state rendering of `<<`, `>>`, and `Up`). `Top` is rendered
 * unconditionally enabled, per Section C.
 *
 * resolveLabel (Step 4) is called directly by this component — this is
 * not a boundary violation, since resolveLabel is a pure formatter with
 * no state dependency, not a "navigation resolver" in the sole-caller
 * sense that applies to resolvePaging/resolveUp/resolveTop.
 *
 * Click-handler contract (Slice 5, amended Slice 7):
 * - `<<`/`>>` call controller.pagePrevious()/pageNext(), then
 *   onStateChange(). Both are safe no-ops in the controller when there
 *   is no current object or no sibling — no guard is added here.
 * - `Up` calls controller.goUp(), then onStateChange(), with NO
 *   defensive try/catch. getAvailability().canGoUp already determines
 *   whether the button is enabled; a disabled native button does not
 *   fire click events. If goUp() ever throws through normal
 *   interaction, that indicates a genuine contract violation that must
 *   be visible, not silently swallowed — this is a deliberate
 *   application of "honest failure over silent degradation," not an
 *   oversight. (If goUp() throws, onStateChange() is never reached —
 *   the exception propagates up through the click handler, which is
 *   the intended, visible failure.)
 * - `Top` calls controller.goTop(), then onStateChange(). goTop()
 *   never throws.
 * - No event buses, observer patterns, subscriptions, or global state
 *   are introduced. A single injected callback is the sole
 *   coordination mechanism, approved specifically because there is one
 *   coordinator (CommandCenterView) and several rendering consumers
 *   (this component, NavigationInspector, GatewayView, and
 *   ProjectListView) — the minimal mechanism
 *   sufficient for that shape, not general-purpose infrastructure.
 *
 * Re-render ownership (RESOLVED at Slice 7 — no longer interim):
 * OrientationBarComponent does NOT re-render itself after actions.
 * CommandCenterView owns re-render coordination centrally: it supplies
 * onStateChange, and its implementation calls this component's
 * render() (and NavigationInspector's, GatewayView's, and
 * ProjectListView's render()) after every state
 * change. This was explicitly flagged as deferred at Slice 5 and is
 * now settled, not left open.
 *
 * This component uses Obsidian's DOM convenience methods (`createEl`,
 * `empty`, `addClass`), which only exist at runtime because Obsidian
 * patches HTMLElement's prototype when the app loads — they are NOT
 * plain DOM APIs, despite type-checking as if they were (Obsidian's
 * ambient type declarations make them appear available project-wide).
 * This means this component is NOT actually renderable or testable
 * outside Obsidian's runtime, unlike navigation-controller.ts and
 * orientation.ts, which remain genuinely host-agnostic. First flagged
 * at Slice 4, still true.

 * was never revisited or reconsidered.

 * is supplied only when the current object is a project; resolveLabel
 * itself throws if it's required but omitted, so this function must
