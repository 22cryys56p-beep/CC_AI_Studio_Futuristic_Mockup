/**
 * NavigationController — owns the orientation element's runtime state.
 *
 * WP12 Step 5, Slice 4: adds getAvailability(), a read-only capability
 * snapshot method for UI rendering. NavigationController remains the
 * sole owner of all resolver calls, including this read-only one —
 * OrientationBarComponent (this slice) must never call resolvePaging
 * or resolveUp directly; it reads getAvailability() instead.
 *
 * Slice 2 established the state container and read-only accessor.
 * Slice 3 added the action methods and their resolver wiring.
 * resolveLabel (Step 4) is NOT wired here — label resolution belongs
 * to OrientationBarComponent, which reads state from this controller
 * directly and calls resolveLabel itself (resolveLabel is a pure
 * formatter with no state dependency, not a "navigation resolver" in
 * the sole-caller sense that applies to resolvePaging/resolveUp/
 * resolveTop).
 *
 * No Obsidian API is touched. No UI component exists yet. No
 * connection to a real Metadata Cache — ProjectRecordProvider remains
 * a minimal injected function type, satisfied by a real Obsidian-backed
 * implementation no earlier than Slice 7/8.
 *
 * Ownership and lifetime (frozen, per WP12 Step 5 architecture):
 * NavigationController is owned by CommandCenterView, created in
 * onOpen(), and destroyed in onClose(). No plugin-level singleton.
 * One active Command Center instance only. This class itself does not
 * enforce that lifetime — enforcement is CommandCenterView's
 * responsibility (Slice 7) — but its design assumes a single instance
 * with no retained state across sessions.
 *
 * Frozen initial state contract, per Phase 3 Architecture Record
 * Section D (Category Screen: "Inputs received: none") and the WP12
 * specification's confirmation that the Gateway root has no current
 * object until a selection is made: on construction, there is no
 * object and depth is "gateway". This mirrors NavigationDestination's
 * `{ depth: "gateway" }` shape from Step 3/4 — no object field, by
 * design, not missing data.
 *
 * Approved state-transition contracts (Slice 3):
 * - selectCategory/selectProject are NOT produced by any Step 1–3
 *   resolver — no resolver models "an object was just chosen from a
 *   shallower screen." The controller constructs these transitions
 *   directly.
 * - selectProject derives its category from the controller's CURRENT
 *   state (state.object must already be a category object, i.e. List
 *   depth) — no ProjectRecord lookup is performed to determine
 *   category. Calling selectProject when state.object is not a
 *   category is a caller-contract violation and throws, matching the
 *   "honest failure over silent degradation" precedent from WP11/Step 1.
 * - pageNext/pagePrevious no-op (state unchanged) when state.object is
 *   null — this is an expected, reachable state during normal use
 *   (initial state, or immediately after goTop), not a caller error.
 * - goUp throws when state.object is null — Up is only ever
 *   legitimately enabled with a project object at workspace depth;
 *   a null object at that depth would indicate an inconsistent state,
 *   not a normal disabled case, so it is NOT treated the same as the
 *   pageNext/pagePrevious no-op case.
 *
 * Approved availability contract (Slice 4):
 * - getAvailability() is a pure, read-only capability snapshot:
 *   { canPagePrevious, canPageNext, canGoUp }. It computes these by
 *   calling resolvePaging/resolveUp internally (the same resolvers
 *   the action methods already use) and checking for a null result,
 *   without mutating state. No canGoTop is included — per Section C,
 *   Top is always enabled once the orientation element is present at
 *   all, so there is nothing for an availability check to report.
 * - When state.object is null, all three flags are false — mirroring
 *   pageNext/pagePrevious's no-op behavior and goUp's throw behavior:
 *   nothing is available to page or move up from when there is no
 *   current object. (getAvailability() itself never throws, even
 *   though goUp() would in this state — an availability check
 *   reporting "not available" is not the same operation as attempting
 *   the action itself.)
