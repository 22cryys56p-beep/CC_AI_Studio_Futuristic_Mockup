- P4-R793 — New Project should remain accessible from Project List while Ideas/New Project workflows remain valid alternate entry points — KEEP-Foundation
- P4-R794 — Paused/waiting Projects should remain discoverable rather than being treated as nonexistent — KEEP-Foundation
- P4-R795 — Project State and Project Visibility are separate concepts. `ProjectRecord.status` is authoritative for project state; visibility is derived from status and the current CC view/navigation context and is not a separate persisted ProjectRecord property — KEEP-Foundation

---

*(Note: Category 64's "Project State" examples in the source material — Current, Planning, Idea, Paused, Completed, Archived — list several values that overlap with or reintroduce the rejected Category 49 taxonomy. Only the single-tier `ProjectRecord.status` field plus the Category 1 five-value vocabulary is authoritative; "Paused" and "Completed" as formal states remain rejected per the Category 49 correction in the prior chunk.)*

## Cross-Category Architectural Foundations (Steps 50–64)

- Navigation is not the data model — Dashboard/Workspace/Search are views, not objects
- Stable IDs are more fundamental than physical locations
- Obsidian is a replaceable interface, not the architecture — "the current host of Command Center, not the boundary of Command Center"
- Synchronization is future work, not a Phase 4 concern
- Recovery must preserve the CC knowledge model, not merely restore files
- Discovery, Access, and Authority are three separate, increasingly narrow boundaries
- Credentials do not belong in ordinary CC records
- External systems remain external; CC references rather than warehouses them via Connectors
- Human authority, AI recommendation, and Agent action are three fundamentally different things — "AI can assist the architect. AI does not become the architect."
- Provenance distinguishes Fact → Interpretation → Recommendation → Human Decision → Action → Result
- Project Re-entry is a first-class capability, not an incidental feature
- Dashboard = orient me; Workspace = let me work; Project List = which one?
